The completed requested file is named: tidy_data.txt
*DATA*
The tidy_data.txt document is the text file with the completed dataset that has been completed as requested in the project description.

The fist row contains the names of the variables.
The subsequent rows contain the values of these variables.

INFO: Identifiers
subject - Subject identifier, integer, ranges from 1 to 30.

activity - Activity identifier, string with 6 available values:
WALKING: subject was walking
WALKING_UPSTAIRS: subject was walking upstairs
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS: subject was walking downstairs
SITTING: subject was sitting
STANDING: subject was standing
LAYING: subject was laying

INFO: Transformations - The following transformations were applied to the dataset:
1. The training and test sets were merged to create 1 data set.
2. The measurments on the mean and standard deviation were extracted for each individual measurment and the rest were ignored.
3. The activity identifiers were replaced with the descriptive activity names as detailed above.
4. The variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names as detailled:
(e.g. tBodyAcc-mean()-X was expanded to timeDomainBodyAccelerometerMeanX), using the following set of rules:
Special characters (i.e. (, ), and -) were removed
The initial f and t were expanded to frequencyDomain and timeDomain respectively.
Acc, Gyro, Mag, Freq, mean, and std were replaced with Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnitude, Frequency, Mean, and StandardDeviation respectively.
Replaced (supposedly incorrect as per source's features_info.txt file) BodyBody with Body.
5. With the resultant data set acheived in step 4, the final data set was created indicating the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
All the results were acheived from  the script created and stored as: run_analysis.R located in this project.
